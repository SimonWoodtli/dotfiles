These are my dotfiles that I use daily. I hope you find something useful here. :wink:

## Installation

Sorry, but there's no fully automated installation script that could be run on a fresh installation and produce a full-blown setup in a one shot. I tried to implement it in a past, but it turns to be overcomplicated. It's better to copy and run a piece of code and validate the outcome.

Basically, this repo contains set of config files that are symlinked or copied somewhere in a \$HOME directory. See setup file as a primer and some setup files scattered around various folders.

- If you want to get my whole bashrc have a ~/.gitconfig with your username configured. As \$GITUSER requires it and many environmental variables depend on it. 
* Also feel free to adjust the \$CDPATH to your favorite places for easy navigation.
* Also many env. variables depend on having this dotfiles repo cloned here: ~/Repos/github.com/SimonWoodtli/dotfiles

### Folder Structure

* bin/ contains program specific configurations files
* bin/install contains software installation scripts they are tested with Arch, Debian and Fedora
* bin/shell contains all files sourced to your bashrc
* scripts/ contains custom scripts, mostly my own
* dircolors/ contains files for `dircolors` to add custom colors to `ls`
* share/ contains data files for some scripts. Mostly because I was too lazy to upload them somewhere.

### My Environment

* terminal: default OS terminal, windows terminal
* terminal font: 'Ubuntu Mono Nerd Font' from [NerdFonts]
* terminal colors: gruvbox
* shell: bash
* editor: vim
* multiplexer: tmux
* file manager: mostly unix commands with \$CDPATH and a few custom fzf commands

### My CLI Apps

I listed some apps that I like and often use. They can all be found to be installed via a script for Arch, Debian and Fedora on my bin/install folder.

* [ripgrep] for full-text search, modern replacement for `grep`.
* [fd] to find files on a file system, modern replacement for `find`.
* up-to-date version of GNU utilities (e.g. `sed`, `tar`, `grep`, `find`, etc.)
* [fzf] to fuzzy find files. It's versatile enough and not limited to files only scenario. You can pipe pretty much anything through it and get  a nice fuzzy selector interface and apply arbitrary action to the selected item or items. Examples are text search matches, brew formulas, npm packages, git commits, git branches, etc.
* [bat] same to `cat` but with syntax highlighting.
* [curl] and [wget] to download files
* [jq] lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor, without interactive interface.
* [htop] for interactive process management, or fancy [bashtop]
* [rsync] to copy files and directories when stock `cp` is just not enough.
* [nmap] to scan nodes on a network, probe open ports and check remote running apps.
* [bed] binary/hex editor written in Go. Alternatively, use `xxd`, `hexdump` or `od` to view files in a binary/hex mode.
* [docker] create containers for virtualization if a VM is overkill
* [browser-sync] create local http server which automatically updates sites when you save files and works on all your devices in your LAN
* [tldr] to list a given command with commonly used flags
* [cheat] to get your coding question answered within terminal
* [ventoy] to have multiple bootable ISOs on a USB-Stick
* [dust] to check file sizes in your file system, modern replacement for `du`
* [neomutt] email client
* [newsboat] rss reader
* [yt-dlp] to download videos, youtube-dl replacement
* [lynx] terminal web browser
* [xclip] to copy to clipboard
* [shellcheck] check your shell scripts
* [pandoc] file converter
* [weechat] irc client

### CLI Apps I gotta try out

* [rupa/z] tracks your most used directories based on 'frecency', and lets you jump around without having to type fully qualified directory path.
* [direnv] to load directory-local `.envrc` and read environment variables. It's used to load 12factor apps environment variables, create per-project isolated development environments, or load secrets for deployment.
* [httpie] command-line HTTP client for the API era with JSON support, syntax highlighting. More advanced alternative to `curl` or `wget`.
* [mptre/yank] to yank terminal output to clipboard through a simple selection interface.
* [antonmedv/fx] command line JSON processing and interactive viewer tool. Alternatively, use 
* [ncdu] ncurses disk usage program.
* [httrack] to copy whole website for offline viewing.
* [bandwhich] CLI utility for displaying current network utilization by process, connection and remote IP/hostname.
* [up] tool for writing Linux pipes with instant live preview.
* [mediainfo] a unified display of technical and tag data for video and audio files.

### GUI Apps

They can be installed for Arch, Debian and Fedora via my install scripts in bin/install

* [VirtualBox] to create and run virtual machines, type 2 hypervisor
* [VMware Workstation] to create and run virtual machines, type 2 hypervisor
* [draw.io] to create flowcharts and diagrams
* [Ferdium] to channel all communication apps in one
* [mpv] to open videos
* [feh] to open pictures
* [Anki] to study with a flash card management
* [LocalWP] to create wordpress websites
* [MuPDF] to open pdfs
* [Zeal] to read documentation offline
* [RustDesk] to connect with remote computers for remote access and control

### Git Tools

* [delta] syntax-highlighting pager
* [gh cli] official github cli
* [vim-fugitive] plugin
* [my git aliases]
* [forgit] git commands with fzf
