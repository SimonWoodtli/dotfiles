# Allows the reading of all combined arguments into a string buffer that
# is then echoed, or if no arguments are detected reads fully from
# standard input until there is none left and echoes that. This is notable
# because it allows the usage of heredoc input instead of arguments making
# for much cleaner blocks of text See htitle, tell (which is used in the
# and the setup script including in this repo) for how to use it.
## needed for `htitle nameYourTitle`
