## forgot what the idea of this project was ğŸ¥³
## I think it was about creating notes for books, study papers with some 
## additional useful information. However I never finished this.
## idea: integrate this functionality with doi/bib/isbn into `zet` script
current_time=$(date "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
doi="$(pdf2doi ${1})"
bib=$(curl -s "http://api.crossref.org/works/$doi/transform/application/x-bibtex")
title=$(echo "$bib" | sed -n '1p' | cut -d{ -f2 | sed 's/,//')

cd $HOME/Repos/github.com/SimonWoodtli/notes/papers
echo 'Do you want to add some tags?'
read tags
echo "\`\`\`yml
id: $current_time
tag: $tags
